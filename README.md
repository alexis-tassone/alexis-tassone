### 🖋️ Profile
I am a technical analyst driven by the intersection of **NLP, Computer Vision, and Humanitarian Impact.** With a background in Mathematics from the University of Toronto, I focus on turning complex, messy data into structured insights that solve human-centric problems. I believe that data is most powerful when it is accurate, well-structured, and used to better people's lives.

* **Current Role:** Junior Data Operations Analyst at **Citylitics**, supporting data quality for infrastructure and public-impact datasets.
* **Core Philosophy:** High accuracy and documentation rigour are the bedrock of reliable AI.
* **Technical Mission:** Leveraging analytical rigour to build models that solve human-centric problems.
